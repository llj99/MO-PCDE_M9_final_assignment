# Codio Coding Activity 4.1: Database Selection and Design 

**Author: Jessica Cervi**

**Expected Time = 60 minutes**

**Total Points = 20**

**Learning Outcome Addressed:**
- 8. Manipulate a database in a coding environment.


--------

## Overview

In this coding activity, you will be required to complete exercises about database selection and basic physical design. You will be guided through an interactive activity that will require you to visualize a table from an existing database. You will also be asked to select columns and values based on a specific type of filter. Finally, you will be required to create a new empty table and retrieve the final database.

### How do I answer questions?

Throughout the activity, you will find code cells that start with:

`### GRADED###`

This is a *graded* cell. In this cell, you will find the variables you will need to use to answer the questions initialized to `None`. 

Below, you will see the following code:

`raise NotImplementedError()`

If you get this error, delete the code "raise NotImplementedError()" and enter your solution to the question.

To submit answer, delete the code above and start typing your using the variables we have provided for you and as many auxiliary variables you may think are necessary.
 
You will also see that every `### GRADED###` is followed by an empty code cell. These are *autograded* cells. These cells contain the code that it's  used to check your answer.  Therefore, these cells are locked from your view.


To make sure your answer is recorded by the autograder, run **both** the graded and the autograded cells. You can do so by clicking  `shift` + `return` on your keyboard.


### How do I submit an activity?

Once you have completed the activity, you can submit it for grading and feedback  by clicking on "Education" at the top and then "Mark as completed".

If you decide to go back and edit some of your answers (perhaps because you did not get full points), you can open the activity, click on  "Education" at the top and then "Mark 
as incomplete". This will give you the possibility of editing your activity.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If you have trouble with the steps above, please try to reload your activity by closing the Jupyter Notebook and by reopening it  using the panel on the left. Do not hesitate to contact your Program Support or your Learning Facilitator!
